>Relational schema from entity relationship model

**Step 1: Identifying Strong Entities**

	There are four major entities (TEAM, REFEREE, GAMEPLAYERS, PLAYERS). The relationship between each entity is created and connected between entity to entity. Each entity contains simple attributes; among those attributes, the entity is uniquely identified, which is called a primary key.
 
Team (teamID, nameOfTeam, located, noOfPlayers, noOfTrophies, ranking, mainStadium, league, establishment, successRate, managerName, ownerName, transferBudget, clubWorth, website)
 
Referee (RefereeID, RefereeName, DOB, country, position, YOE, yellowcardIssued, redcardIssued)
 
Gameplayers (playerID, goalsScored, dispossession, possession, assists, shotson, shotsoff, accuracy, tackles, clearones, duels, saves, fouls, offsides, yellowcard, redcard)
 
Players (playerID, name, place, nationality, dob,startYear,shirtno,height,playerPosition,matchesPlayed,playersRecord)
 
**Step 2: Identifying Weak Entities**

	There is one weak entity (MATCH). The relationship is created for the weak entity, and it contains some simple attributes. The primary key for this weak entity is identified as partially unique.
 
Match (matchno,teamID,guestTeamID,RefereeID,home_ground,date,scorerName,hostScore,guestScore,finalResult)
 
**Step 3: One-to-One relationships**

	The one-to-one relationship is located for Gameplayers entity to substitution relationship. The attributes for the substitution relationship are created. The primary key for this relationship is uniquely identifiable.
 
One-to-One Relationship: substitution
 
Gameplayers (playerID,goalsScored,dispossession,possession,assists,shotson,shotsoff,accuracy,tackles,clearones,duels,saves,fouls,offsides,yellowcard,redcard,substitution_playerID*,substitution_time)
 

**Step 4: One-to-Many Relationship**
 
There are six one-to-Many relationships in this ER diagram. Host, guest, role, played, plays, belongs. The primary key of the entities in between the relationship is the foreign key for that entities.
Team (teamID,nameOfTeam,located,noOfPlayers,noOfTrophies,ranking,mainStadium,league,establishment,successRate,managerName,ownerName,transferBudget,clubWorth,website)
 
Referee (RefereeID,RefereeName,DOB,country,position,YOE,yellowcardIssued,redcardIssued)
 
Gameplayers (playerID,goalsScored,dispossession,possession,assists,shotson,shotsoff,accuracy,tackles,clearones,duels,saves,fouls,offsides,yellowcard,redcard,substitution_playerID*,substitution_time)
 
Players (playerID,name,place,nationality,dob,startYear,shirtno,height,playerPosition,matchesPlayed,playersRecord,teamID*,substitution_playerID*)
 
Match (matchno,teamID,guestTeamID,RefereeID,home_ground,date,scorerName,hostScore,guestScore,finalResult,teamID*,RefereeID*)
 
**Step 5: Many-to-Many Relationship**
 
There are no Many to Many Relationship in this ERD Diagram.
 
**Step 6: Multivalued attributes**
 
There are no Multivalued Attributes in this ER Diagram.
 
**Step 7: N-ary Relationships**
 
In this ER-Diagram, there are two N-ary Relationships. Host, substitution.
 
N-ary Relationships: Host, Substitution
 
Team (teamID,nameOfTeam,located,noOfPlayers,noOfTrophies,ranking,mainStadium,league,establishment,successRate,managerName,ownerName,transferBudget,clubWorth,website)
 
Referee (RefereeID,RefereeName,DOB,country,position,YOE,yellowcardIssued,redcardIssued)
 
Gameplayers (playerID,goalsScored,dispossession,possession,assists,shotson,shotsoff,accuracy,tackles,clearones,duels,saves,fouls,offsides,yellowcard,redcard,substitution_playerID*,substitution_time*)
 
Players (playerID,name,place,nationality,dob,startYear,shirtno,height,playerPosition,matchesPlayed,playersRecord,teamID*,substitution_playerID*)
 
Match (matchno,teamID,guestTeamID,RefereeID,home_ground*,date,scorerName,hostScore,guestScore,finalResult,teamID*,RefereeID*)
 
**Step 8: Super and Subclass**
 
There are No super and sub classes in this ER diagram.
